# BANK CUSTOMER CHURN USING EXCEL AND PYTHON

## Business   Problem

Customer churn analysis focuses on understanding and reducing customer attrition. It examines why customers discontinue using a company’s products or services — a major concern in many sectors due to its impact on revenue, market share, and the higher costs of attracting new customers to replace those who leave.

The analysis aims to identify the reasons behind customer churn and predict which customers might leave. This enables companies to take preemptive actions to keep their customers. By resolving issues that cause dissatisfaction, enhancing the customer experience, and deploying specific retention strategies, companies can lower churn rates, thereby boosting customer loyalty and increasing profitability.

Thus, the fundamental issue that customer churn analysis tackles is how to effectively reduce customer losses and enhance retention to help the business thrive and expand.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Ensure data is clean and well-organized involves removing any duplicate records, filling in missing values, and correctly formatting the data.

## Calculating Churn Rate: 

Churn rate is defined as the percentage of customers who discontinue using your product or service over a specific timeframe.

 It is calculated using the formula:

Churn Rate = ((Number of Customers Lost in the given period / Total Number of Customers at the start of the Period) * 100).

To compute this, we will employ Excel functions such as COUNTIF along with other relevant formulas.


## Data Analysis: 

Leverage Excel's built-in tools such as pivot tables, charts, and formulas to analyze customer data, identifying patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to churn. We will conduct basic analyses, including regression analysis, to determine which factors correlate with churn, utilizing Excel’s Data Analysis Toolpak for these purposes.

## Dashboard Visualization: 

Develop visualizations, including charts and graphs, to effectively present our findings.

### Churn Metrics Overview:

Provide a summary of key churn metrics, including the overall churn rate, trends in monthly or quarterly churn rates, and the count of customers lost over time.

### Customer Segmentation:

Segment the customer base according to demographics, purchasing behaviors, or other pertinent factors. We will then display churn rates and trends for each segment to pinpoint groups at high risk of churn.

### Churn Drivers Analysis:

Analyze factors that contribute to churn, such as customer satisfaction scores, service usage metrics, and customer support interactions. Charts and tables will be used to visualize the correlations between these factors and churn rates.
